# clr-solutions

This repository contains my solutions and notes from working through _Command-Line Rust_ by Ken Youens-Clark. The book teaches Rust through practical command-line tools, and this repo collects my implementations chapter by chapter.

## Structure

Each chapter has its own directory and standalone Cargo project.

## Purpose

This repo serves as a record of my progress and a place to keep the exercises organised and easy to review.

## License

All code is my own work and is released under the MIT License.
